Simply make your desired changes and submit your pull request. At this point, there is no specific format you have to follow, just make sure the code is easily readable, and if possible comment where possible so that the pull request could be approved faster.

### To help

Install the tool, and try out the different examples or even build your own, and try to break the tool. Once you break it, just make sure to inform us via the ISSUES pages, about the issue.

## Testing Policy

[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/fuck-it-ship-it.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

I will ensure everything works, however I won't be building any unit-tests at this time.

---

Stable versions via npm (incase your version contains certain bugs, try these builds):

- 1.0.46
- 1.0.56

### Git Version

Frequently the Github source will not be the same version as the latest npm version. This is because the npm versions are often the stable ones. Github will contain the developmental and possibly even broken versions at times (official versions will be stated in the commit)

### Tracking

This tool has statistics built-in to allow only the main developer to track usage of the tool. This tracking is anonymous and if need be, can be disabled at will using the configuration. I may use the tracking to ensure certain functionality is working as intended, and also to ensure this tool is used (low usage, may mean that I do not need to keep updating).
